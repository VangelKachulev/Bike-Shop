Bike shop - Single Page Application written in React.js. 
The application is divided into components with separate CSS files. The application have Public Part (Accessible without authentication) and Private Part (Available for Registered Users). Client-side routing is implemented.
Also there are dropdown menu,search box and comment section where only signed users can leave a comment.
I demonstrate the use of programming concepts, specific to the React library: stateless and state full components, controlled components React Hooks, Context API. 
I applied data validation to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered.
I uploaded some images to get familiar with the project.
