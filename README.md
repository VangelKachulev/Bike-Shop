Bike shop - Single Page Application written in React.js. 
The application is divided into components with separate CSS files. The application have Public Part (Accessible without authentication) and Private Part (Available for Registered Users). Client-side routing is implemented.
I demonstrate the use of programming concepts, specific to the React library: stateless and state full components, React Hooks, Context API. 
I applied data validation to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered.


Start Client side: Open a terminal on vscode, then make sure you enter the folder 'Client' and type 'npm install' and then  'npm start'
Start server: Open new terminal on vscode, then make sure you enter the server folder  and type 'node server.js'
